The list of major chromosome X regions has been acquired from the 2019 Webster  et al. [cite:@websterIdentifyingUnderstandingCorrecting2019]
The list of low complexity and ampliconic regions has been acquired from the 2019 Cotter et al. [cite:@cotterGeneticDiversityHuman2016]

* Reproducing the results
The pipeline can be run with nextflow and docker.

#+begin_src shell
nextflow main.nf
